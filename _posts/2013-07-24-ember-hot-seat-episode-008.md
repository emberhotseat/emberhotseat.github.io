Slowing down on the prolific rate of output a bit, we have this week's guest [Alex Matchneer](https://twitter.com/machty) Alex talks about his inspiration about the Ember Router in RC6, emblem.js, and [Embercasts](http://embercasts.com). We also talk about his journey into the open source world and gives advice on how people can get started.

I want to apologize in advance for some of the sound glitches. Skype was not being very friendly that day. Thanks again for listening and I hope you enjoy.
