excerpt: "In our latest Hot Seat Episode, we have Igor Terzic. Of course we spent most of our time talking about Ember Data and what's coming down the pipeline, best practices, etc... Interestingly enough, Igor thought he didn't have enough to talk about for a 30 minute podcast and this one ended up being close to an hour. Sit back, relax, and I hope you enjoy."

In our latest Hot Seat Episode, we have [Igor Terzic](https://twitter.com/terzicigor). Of course we spent most of our time talking about Ember Data and what's coming down the pipeline, best practices, etc... Interestingly enough, Igor thought he didn't have enough to talk about for a 30 minute podcast and this one ended up being close to an hour. Sit back, relax, and I hope you enjoy.
