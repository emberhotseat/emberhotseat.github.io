Hey there Embere√±os! Sorry for the delay in updates. It was the holiday season, so that meant travel for everyone, including myself. I'm fortunate to have my midwest brethren, [Toran Billups](http://twitter.com/toranb) on the show this week. Toran dives into his journey into Ember from a Python developer's perspective, testing with Ember(shoutout to [Erik Bryn](http://twitter.com/ebryn)), getting his team sold on Ember, and how important it is to give back to the community. As always, please leave comments and feedback in the post or on our Twitter handle [@emberhotseat](http://twitter.com/emberhotseat). Thanks again for tuning in!
