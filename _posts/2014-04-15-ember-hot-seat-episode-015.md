This week in the Ember Hot Seat we have newly minted core team member [Robert Jackson](https://twitter.com/rwjblue). I couldn't have him on the show and not talk about the tooling he developed for the build system for Ember.js. We also talk about his recent move to the Dockyard team in Boston and a host of other topics. Hope you enjoy!
