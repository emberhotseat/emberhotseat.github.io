excerpt: "Wrapping up this jam packed week on Ember Hot Seat, we have Yehuda Katz. You are in for a definite treat as he talks about Ember 1.1, Ember Data, and his views on Angular. He also gives his wish list for the platform, talks about the differences between his and DHH's view on the browser as a platform, and we take a reflective view on the Ember's history to talk about some of the things he might have done differently. It's hard to digest our conversation into a simple intro, because our 30 minute conversation turned into an hour on a Friday night. That's love and dedication, but we've got to give the people what they want. It was a definitely pleasure and I learned a ton, so I'm sure you all will as well."

Wrapping up this jam packed week on Ember Hot Seat, we have [Yehuda Katz](http://twitter.com/wycats). You are in for a definite treat as he talks about Ember 1.1, Ember Data, and his views on Angular. He also gives his wish list for the platform, talks about the differences between [his](http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/252/67651822.png) and [DHH](http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/dc9/tupac.jpg)'s view on the browser as a platform, and we take a reflective view on the Ember's history to talk about some of the things he might have done differently. It's hard to digest our conversation into a simple intro, because our 30 minute conversation turned into an hour on a Friday night. That's love and dedication, but we've [got to give the people what they want](http://youtu.be/TxoL3uQbPoc?t=21s). It was a definitely pleasure and I learned a ton, so I'm sure you all will as well. 

Oh and before I forget, I made reference to a [post](http://ryanflorence.com/2013/es6-modules-and-browser-app-delivery/) by [Ryan Florence](http://twitter.com/ryanflorence). He talks about the need for better tooling and dependency management in browsers. It's a very informative post and Yehuda also talks about the need for a better story around this issue. Without further delay...
