Welcome back! Sorry for the hiatus, but I come bearing gifts. This week we have Ember Core Team member [Erik Bryn](https://twitter.com/ebryn) in the Hot Seat. We talk about HTMLBars and his not so scientific but cool anyways showdown with React, upgrading [Zendesk](http://developer.zendesk.com) to Ember 1.X, Ember testing, the landscape of the Ember economy, and the hierarchy of his favorite bourbons. If you've seen Erik talk, you know his appreciation of fine whiskey and bourbon. Also if you haven't done it already, please grab your tickets for [EmberConf](http://emberconf.com). To say they have been selling like hot cakes would be an understatement. Until next time.

P.S. If anyone wants to be in the Hot Seat contact me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emberhotseat).
