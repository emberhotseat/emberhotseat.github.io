This week in the Hot Seat, we have [Brian Cardarella](https://twitter.com/bcardarella) from [DockYard](http://dockyard.com). We cover a lot of things from his [ember-validations](https://github.com/dockyard/ember-validations) library, to his involvement in the Boston and DC Ember communities, running a consultancy that is looking to specialize in Ember, coming to Ember from a Rails background, some pain points with Ember, and his self admitted tragic experience speaking at Ember Camp.

I realized after we finished recording that I forgot to go in depth about [ember-easyForm](https://github.com/dockyard/ember-easyForm). If you'd like to learn more about the project, check it out on GitHub.

Hope you enjoy!
