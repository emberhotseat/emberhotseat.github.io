Continuing our busy week on Ember Hot Seat, we have my fellow Zengineer, [James A. Rosen](http://twitter.com/jamesarosen)! James gives insights as to how we're using Ember at [Zendesk](http://developer.zendesk.com) including the long road in upgrading to 1.0, internationalization, data persistance, testing, and a lot of other cool things we do. James also gives some tips for staying happy and his personal favorite recipe he learned while studying culinary arts in Italy. I call it the "Abuse of Power" episode, but man does it feel classy :-) I hope you all enjoy!
