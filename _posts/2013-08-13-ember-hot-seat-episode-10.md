Back at it again with another episode of Ember Hot Seat. We have a very special guest this time around, [Luke Melia](https://twitter.com/lukemelia) from [Yapp](https://www.yapp.us/). We talk about a host of things including Ember performance, why he chose Ember at Yapp, balancing contributing to the platform and shipping product, and his opinion on what is Ember's killer feature. Luke also puts me in the Hot Seat at the end of the show, so it's definitely worth listening.

Also before I get the tweets, I know the audio is off on this episode. Luke apparently has THE loudest headset microphone known to man :-) and I didn't feel like going in and editing an hour of audio to get the levels right for both of us. I promise I'll do an audio check the next time. Hopefully you enjoy listening as much as I did interviewing. Thank you all again for tuning in and if you have any feedback, feel free to comment or [tweet us](http://twitter.com/emberhotseat).
