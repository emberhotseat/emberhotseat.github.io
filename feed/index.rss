      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week in the Hot Seat we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/cavneb&quot;&gt;Eric Berry&lt;/a&gt;. Eric&amp;#39;s written some great &lt;a href=&quot;http://coderberry.me/&quot;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt; recently and I wanted to get his unique view of Ember and highlight some of the work he&amp;#39;s done. If you&amp;#39;re looking at Ember or need an extra push diving into the platform, this is a great episode to listen to. Thanks again for tuning in. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Slowing down on the prolific rate of output a bit, we have this week&amp;#39;s guest &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/machty&quot;&gt;Alex Matchneer&lt;/a&gt; Alex talks about his inspiration about the Ember Router in RC6, emblem.js, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://embercasts.com&quot;&gt;Embercasts&lt;/a&gt;. We also talk about his journey into the open source world and gives advice on how people can get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to apologize in advance for some of the sound glitches. Skype was not being very friendly that day. Thanks again for listening and I hope you enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wrapping up this jam packed week on Ember Hot Seat, we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/wycats&quot;&gt;Yehuda Katz&lt;/a&gt;. You are in for a definite treat as he talks about Ember 1.1, Ember Data, and his views on Angular. He also gives his wish list for the platform, talks about the differences between &lt;a href=&quot;http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/252/67651822.png&quot;&gt;his&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/dc9/tupac.jpg&quot;&gt;DHH&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s view on the browser as a platform, and we take a reflective view on the Ember&amp;#39;s history to talk about some of the things he might have done differently. It&amp;#39;s hard to digest our conversation into a simple intro, because our 30 minute conversation turned into an hour on a Friday night. That&amp;#39;s love and dedication, but we&amp;#39;ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/TxoL3uQbPoc?t=21s&quot;&gt;got to give the people what they want&lt;/a&gt;. It was a definitely pleasure and I learned a ton, so I&amp;#39;m sure you all will as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and before I forget, I made reference to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ryanflorence.com/2013/es6-modules-and-browser-app-delivery/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/ryanflorence&quot;&gt;Ryan Florence&lt;/a&gt;. He talks about the need for better tooling and dependency management in browsers. It&amp;#39;s a very informative post and Yehuda also talks about the need for a better story around this issue. Without further delay...&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing our busy week on Ember Hot Seat, we have my fellow Zengineer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jamesarosen&quot;&gt;James A. Rosen&lt;/a&gt;! James gives insights as to how we&amp;#39;re using Ember at &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.zendesk.com&quot;&gt;Zendesk&lt;/a&gt; including the long road in upgrading to 1.0, internationalization, data persistance, testing, and a lot of other cool things we do. James also gives some tips for staying happy and his personal favorite recipe he learned while studying culinary arts in Italy. I call it the &amp;quot;Abuse of Power&amp;quot; episode, but man does it feel classy :-) I hope you all enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an action packed week here at the Ember Hot Seat. This episode we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/ghempton&quot;&gt;Gordon Hempton&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://grouptalent.com&quot;&gt;GroupTalent&lt;/a&gt; on the show. In this highly anticipated episode, he talks about &lt;a href=&quot;http://epf.io&quot;&gt;EPF, Ember Persistence Foundation,&lt;/a&gt; and why he felt it was necessary to build another data persistence library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel bad because the conversation we had afterwards was equally engaging, so we&amp;#39;ll bring him back to the Hot Seat soon!  If you have any feedback, please don&amp;#39;t hesitate to reach out on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/emberhotseat&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or comment. Thanks again for tuning in.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there Embereños! Sorry for the delay in updates. It was the holiday season, so that meant travel for everyone, including myself. I&amp;#39;m fortunate to have my midwest brethren, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/toranb&quot;&gt;Toran Billups&lt;/a&gt; on the show this week. Toran dives into his journey into Ember from a Python developer&amp;#39;s perspective, testing with Ember(shoutout to &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/ebryn&quot;&gt;Erik Bryn&lt;/a&gt;), getting his team sold on Ember, and how important it is to give back to the community. As always, please leave comments and feedback in the post or on our Twitter handle &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/emberhotseat&quot;&gt;@emberhotseat&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks again for tuning in!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Ember Hot Seat listeners! We&amp;#39;re back this week with &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/kaspertidemann&quot;&gt;Kasper Tidemann&lt;/a&gt;, CTO and cofounder of Meemo, in the Hot Seat. He&amp;#39;s going to give his perspective on getting started with Ember, his journey in choosing Ember, and how he&amp;#39;s overcome some of the difficulties. We also touch on why it&amp;#39;s important to give back to the community and why Ember was the framework of choice for his company. Kasper made mention of his &lt;a href=&quot;http://kaspertidemann.com&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; and to a video he would record of his own JS framework &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/68185861&quot;&gt;meeho.js&lt;/a&gt;. I hope you enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we&amp;#39;ve recorded it in stereo AAAAAAND even have some theme music provided by a good friend of mine &lt;a href=&quot;http://futureperfekt.net&quot;&gt;Mitchell Wilcox&lt;/a&gt; haha. The production quality keeps going up with each week. I&amp;#39;m still waiting on iTunes podcast approval, but if you&amp;#39;d like to subscribe to the RSS feed, you can do it here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://emberhotseat.com/feed/index.xml&quot;&gt;http://emberhotseat.com/feed/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;d like to be in the Hot Seat or have feedback on the show, please reach out to us on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/emberhotseat&quot;&gt;@emberhotseat&lt;/a&gt;. We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;
