<p><strong><a href="http://twitter.com/devarispbrown">DeVaris Brown</a></strong>, your host for the Ember Hot Seat, is the API Guy for <a href="http://developer.zendesk.com"><strong>Zendesk</strong></a> by day and part time Ember.js enthusiast. When he's not preaching the gospel of the Zendesk developer platform to the masses, you'll find him with his hands firmly planted on a camera or a set of turntables. His goal for doing this podcast is to break down the barriers people have in developing with Ember, and not make it sound like there's a substitute science teacher speaking. He's not as bad as the picture looks now is he?</p>
