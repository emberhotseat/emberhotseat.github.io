        <p>Wrapping up this jam packed week on Ember Hot Seat, we have Yehuda Katz. You are in for a definite treat as he talks about Ember 1.1, Ember Data, and his views on Angular. He also gives his wish list for the platform, talks about the differences between his and DHH's view on the browser as a platform, and we take a reflective view on the Ember's history to talk about some of the things he might have done differently. It's hard to digest our conversation into a simple intro, because our 30 minute conversation turned into an hour on a Friday night. That's love and dedication, but we've got to give the people what they want. It was a definitely pleasure and I learned a ton, so I'm sure you all will as well.</p>

        <p>Continuing our busy week on Ember Hot Seat, we have my fellow Zengineer, James A. Rosen! James gives insights as to how we're using Ember at Zendesk. He talks about the long road in upgrading to 1.0, internationalization, data persistance, testing, and a lot of other cool things we do to make sure our Ember application is performant for millions of users. James also gives some tips for staying happy and his personal favorite recipe he learned while studying culinary arts in Italy. Enjoy!</p>

        <p>This episode we have Gordon Hempton of GroupTalent on the show. In this highly anticipated episode, he talks about EPF, Ember Persistence Foundation, and why he felt it was necessary to build another data persistence library. While this is one of our shortest episodes, it's definitely full of quality information for those that may be facing the same issues as Gordon. Hope you enjoy!</p>
